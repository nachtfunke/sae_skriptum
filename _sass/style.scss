	style.scss

	This is the Main Boostrap file. It includes and requires all other needed
	scss files, as well as bourbon, or compass, or whatever else you use.

	I do not use cross-browser compatibility mixins anymore, as autoprexer made
	this subject pretty much a nobrainer. I highly recommend everyone to do the
	same, but still, everyone has differnt tools and works differently. So feel
	free to do whatever you want.

	Bootstrapping all Partials

	This way of organizing is called ITCSS, which originates from Harry Roberts.
	The later the included partial, the more specific the selector gets. Its Aim
	is it, to keep the specifity graph throughout the project as steady growing,
	as possible.

	More can be seen here: http://itcss.io/
